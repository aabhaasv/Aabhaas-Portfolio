        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Aabhaas Vijayvergia, and I'm currently a Computer Science major at UC Davis. I have a passion for building impactful software solutions. My interests span across computer vision, backend development, and embedded systems. I enjoy using technology to tackle real-world problems and find innovative ways to improve systems and create new opportunities. My ultimate goal is to develop software that makes a meaningful difference in people's lives by improving their everyday experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both software engineering principles and machine learning techniques, allowing me to work effectively on projects ranging from object detection models for marine research to backend systems that automate content moderation. I’m always eager to learn, solve complex problems, and collaborate with others to push the boundaries of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I love staying active by playing for the UC Davis Men's Club Soccer team, refereeing soccer games, and going to the gym. Apart from these activities, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family.
        </p>
