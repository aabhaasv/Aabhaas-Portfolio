        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Aabhaas Vijayvergia, a third-year Computer Science major at UC Davis with a passion for building impactful software solutions. My interests span across computer vision, backend development, and embedded systems. I thrive in environments where technology is used to solve real-world problems, and I enjoy applying cutting-edge techniques to improve processes and create new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both software engineering principles and machine learning techniques, allowing me to work effectively on projects ranging from object detection models for marine research to backend systems that automate content moderation. I’m always eager to learn, tackle complex problems, and collaborate with others to push the boundaries of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I love staying active by playing for the UC Davis Men's Club Soccer team and refereeing all levels of soccer games, and working out. Apart from these activities, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family.
