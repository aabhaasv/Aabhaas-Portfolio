        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Aabhaas Vijayvergia, a third-year Computer Science major at UC Davis with a passion for building impactful software solutions. My interests span across computer vision, backend development, and embedded systems. I thrive in environments where technology is used to solve real-world problems, and I enjoy applying cutting-edge techniques to improve processes and create new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both software engineering principles and machine learning techniques, allowing me to work effectively on projects ranging from object detection models for marine research to backend systems that automate content moderation. I’m always eager to learn, tackle complex problems, and collaborate with others to push the boundaries of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy diving into new tech trends, exploring innovative algorithms, and taking part in hackathons to challenge myself and grow as a developer. I’m excited to continue honing my skills and contribute to meaningful projects that have a real-world impact.
